# Asobiba (遊び場)

Asobiba is an experimiental Go playground where the Go toolchain is in WebAssembly.

This is still work in progress.

## How to run on your local machine

1. `go run gen.go -tar [tar file for Go]`. This works only on Linux or macOS so far. The URL for the tar file is shown when you run `go run gen.go` without flags.
2. `go run server.go`
